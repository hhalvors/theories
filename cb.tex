\maketitle

The purpose of this note is to ask: under what conditions could a pair
of theories $(T_1,T_2)$ fail to have the Cantor-Bernstein or
co-Cantor-Bernstein property?

\begin{defn} We say that the pair $(T_1,T_2)$ has the Cantor-Bernstein
  property just in case: if $T_1$ and $T_2$ are mutually faithfully
  interpretable, then $T_1$ and $T_2$ are bi-interpretable. In other
  words: if $(T_1,T_2)$ does not have the Cantor-Bernstein property
  then (a) $T_1$ and $T_2$ are mutually faithfully interpretable, and
  (b) $T_1$ and $T_2$ are not bi-interpretable. \end{defn}

Here ``mutually faithfully interpretable'' means that there are
conservative (strong, equality preserving) translations $F:T_1\to T_2$
and $G:T_2\to T_1$.

\begin{defn} We say that the pair $(T_1,T_2)$ has the
  co-Cantor-Bernstein property just in case: if there are essentially
  surjective translations $F:T_1\to T_2$ and $G:T_2\to T_1$, then
  $T_1$ and $T_2$ are bi-interpretable. \end{defn}




\section{Examples of theory pairs that are not CB}


\begin{enumerate}
\item $T_1$ is the empty theory on a countably infinite propositional
  signature. $T_2$ is the ``fan theory'' with axioms $p_0\vdash p_i$,
  for $i\geq 0$. These theories are counterexamples both to the CB and
  the co-CB properties.

  But are these theories ``pathological'' in some sense? The fact that
  these theories are propositional should not (I think) be seen as a
  pathology. However, these theories are incomplete, and the second of
  them is not finitely axiomatizable.
\item The many examples of pairs of set theories described in \citep[p
  8]{hamkins}.
\item The pair of theories described in \citep{andreka}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Cantor-Bernstein}

The first thing I would like to show: for theories $T_1$ and $T_2$ to
violate Cantor-Bernstein, both have to have infinitely many
non-isomorphic models. (This fact is trivial in the case that $T_1$
and $T_2$ have models of infinite cardinality.)

\begin{note} Let $F:T_1\to T_2$ be a translation, and let
  $F^*:M(T_2)\to M(T_1)$ be the dual functor. Recall that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $F^*(M)\vDash \phi$ iff $M\vDash F(\phi )$, for any
    $\Sigma _1$-sentence $\phi$.
    \item $F^*$ is faithful by definition.
    \item $F^*$ reflects isomorphisms in the sense that if
      $F^*(j):F^*(M)\to F^*(N)$ is an isomorphism, then $j:M\to N$ is
      an isomorphism. This follows from the fact that an elementary
      embedding is an isomorphism iff it is surjective, and from the
      fact that the underlying function of $F^*(j)$ is none other than
      the underlying function of $j$.

      Note however: $F^*$ can still map non-isomorphic models to
      isomorphic models. For example: let $T_1$ be the theory that
      says that there are two things (in empty signature), let $T_2$
      be the theory that says that there are two things (in signature
      with a unary predicate symbol $P$), and let $F:T_1\to T_2$ be
      the inclusion. Let $M$ be a model in which the extension of $P$
      is empty, and let $N$ be a model in which the extension of $P$
      is non-empty. Then $F^*(M)$ is isomorphic to $F^*(N)$ although
      $M$ is not isomorphic to $N$.
    \end{itemize} \end{note}

\begin{defn} We say that a category $C$ is \emph{object-finite} just
  in case it has only finitely many objects up to
  isomorphism. \end{defn}

Let $T$ be a theory. If $M(T)$ is object-finite then the
L{\"o}wenheim-Skolem theorem implies that every model of $T$ has
finite cardinality. From this it follows that every hom set in $M(T)$
is finite. Furthermore, since for finite structures, elementary
equivalence implies isomorphism, it follows that for any
non-isomorphic $M,N$ in $M(T)$, there is a sentence $\phi$ such that
$M\vDash\phi$ and $N\vDash\neg\phi$.

\begin{prop} Let $T_1$ be a theory such that $M(T_1)$ is
  object-finite, and let $F:T_1\to T_2$ be a translation. If $F$ is
  conservative then $F^*:M(T_2)\to M(T_1)$ is essentially
  surjective. \end{prop}
\begin{proof} (1) We prove the contrapositive. If $F^*:M(T_2)\to M(T_1)$
  is not eso, then there is a model $M$ of $T_1$ that is not
  isomorphic to any model of the form $F^*(N)$, with $N$ a model of
  $T_2$. By the preceding discussion, there is a sentence $\phi$ such
  that $M\vDash \phi$ but $F^*(N)\vDash\neg \phi$, for all models $N$
  of $T_2$. Hence $N\vDash F(\neg \phi )$ for all models $N$ of $T_2$,
  and by completeness, $T_2\vdash F(\neg \phi )$. Therefore $F$ is not
  conservative. \end{proof}

\begin{note} Let $C$ and $D$ be categories with respective object sets
  $C_0$ and $D_0$. Let $[C_0]$ and $[D_0]$ be the corresponding sets
  of equivalence classes of isomorphic objects. Each functor
  $F:C\to D$ induces a function $F_0:[C_0]\to [D_0]$, and $F_0$ is
  surjective iff $F$ is eso. If $F:C\to D$ and $G:D\to C$ are both
  eso, then Cantor-Bernstein for finite sets implies that $F_0$ is a
  bijection. \end{note}

\begin{prop} Let $C$ and $D$ be totally-finite categories. If there
  are faithful, eso functors $F:C\to D$ and $G:D\to C$, then $C$ and
  $D$ are equivalent categories. In fact, $F$ itself is one half of an
  equivalence. \end{prop}

\begin{proof} By the above remark, $F_0:[C_0]\to [D_0]$ is a
  bijection. Since $F$ is automatically faithful, it will suffice to
  show that $F$ is full. Here is the idea behind the argument: Take
  objects $a,b\in C_0$ such that $\mathrm{hom}(a,b)$ has maximum
  cardinality among hom sets in $C$.  If
  $F_1:\mathrm{hom}(a,b)\to \mathrm{hom}(Fa,Fb)$ is an injection but
  not a surjection, then we have a contradiction, since $G_1$ is also
  an injection from $\mathrm{hom}(Fa,Fb)$ to
  $\mathrm{hom}(GFa,GFb)$. Hence $F$ is full on these maximum
  cardinality hom sets.

  TO BE COMPLETED. \end{proof}

\begin{conj} If $M(T_1)$ and $M(T_2)$ are object-finite then
  $(T_1,T_2)$ has the Cantor-Bernstein property.  \end{conj}

\section{Co-Cantor-Bernstein}


\begin{prop} If $T_1$ or $T_2$ is complete, then $(T_1,T_2)$ has the
  co-CB property. \end{prop}

\begin{proof} If $T_1$ is complete, then every translation
  $F:T_1\to T_2$ is conservative. So if $F:T_1\to T_2$ is eso, then
  $F$ is a strong equivalence, i.e.\ $T_1$ and $T_2$ are
  bi-interpretable. \end{proof}

Recall that $F:T_1\to T_2$ is conservative iff $F^*:M(T_2)\to M(T_1)$
is a full functor \citep{barrett2020}. Recall also that if $F$ is a
strong (equality-preserving) translation, then $F^*$ preserves
cardinality of models. In particular, if $T_1$ and $T_2$ are
$\aleph _0$-categorical theories, then a translation $F:T_1\to T_2$
induces a group homomorphism
$F^*:\mathrm{Aut}(M_2)\to \mathrm{Aut}(M_1)$, and $F$ is conservative
iff $F^*$ is surjective. (In fact, $\mathrm{Aut}(M_i)$ is naturally a
topological group, and I conjecture that $F^*$ is a continuous group
homomorphism.)

Recall that if $T$ has countable signature, and if $T$ is
$\aleph _0$-categorical, then $T$ is complete. The following result
would be interesting because an $\aleph _0$-categorical theory is
essentially characterized by a topological group, viz.\ the group of
automorphisms of its unique (up to isomorphism) countable model.


\begin{conj} There are $\aleph _0$-categorical theories $T_1$ and
  $T_2$ that do not have the CB property. \end{conj}

\begin{defn} Let $I$ be the set of axioms
  $\{ \exists _{>1},\exists _{>2},\dots \}$. We say that a theory $T$
  is essentially finitely axiomatizable just in case there is a finite
  set $E$ of axioms such that $Cn(T)=Cn(E\cup I)$. \end{defn}

\begin{conj} There are essentially finitely axiomatizable theories
  $T_1$ and $T_2$ that do not have the CB property. \end{conj}

\section{Conjecture: co-CB fails only for theories with many models}

\begin{note} For a theory $T$ and a cardinal number $\kappa$, let
  $I(T,\kappa )$ be the number of non-isomorphic countable models of
  $T$. Interestingly, $I(T,\aleph _0)$ can be countably infinite, or
  any finite cardinal besides $2$. See \citep[p
  155ff]{marker2006}. \end{note}




\begin{prop} If $F:T_1\to T_2$ is essentially surjective, then for any
  fixed cardinal number $\kappa$,
  $I(T_2, \kappa )\leq I(T_1, \kappa )$. \end{prop}

\begin{proof} Recall that the dual functor $F^*$ is always
  faithful. If $F:T_1\to T_2$ is eso, then $F^*$ is also full
  \citep[Prop 6.6.13]{tlps}. In particular, for any models $M,N$ of
  $T_2$, if $F^*(M)$ is isomorphic to $F^*(N)$, then $M$ is isomorphic
  to $N$. Now fix a cardinal number $\kappa$, and let
  $[M(T_i)]_\kappa$ be the set of isomorphism classes of models of
  $T_i$ of cardinality $\kappa$. Then $F^*$ induces a one-to-one
  mapping from $[M(T_2)]_\kappa$ into $[M(T_1)]_\kappa$. \end{proof}

\begin{prop} Suppose that $T_2$ has finitely many non-isomorphic
  models of each cardinality. If $F:T_1\to T_2$ and $G:T_2\to T_1$ are
  essentially surjective, then $(F^*,G^*)$ is an equivalence of
  categories. If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are proper theories then $F^*$ is
  part of a homotopy equivalence. \end{prop}

\begin{proof} For the first part it will suffice to show that $F^*$ is
  essentially surjective. By the previous proof, $G^*$ induces an
  injection of $[M(T_1)]_\kappa$ into $[M(T_2)]_\kappa$. Since the
  latter is finite, so is the former. Since $F^*$ is an injection of
  one finite set into a not-larger finite set, it follows that $F^*$
  is bijection. Therefore $F^*$ is essentially surjective.

  The second part follows from Theorem 7.1 of
  \citep{summer2020}. \end{proof}

\begin{cor} Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be proper theories. If $(T_1,T_2)$
  violate the co-CB property then there is a cardinal number $\kappa$
  such that $T_1$ and $T_2$ have infinitely many non-isomorphic models
  of size $\kappa$. \end{cor}

TO DO: I would like to come up with a similar necessary condition for
$T_1$ and $T_2$ violating the CB property. However, we do not yet have
any interesting result of the form: ``if $T_1$ or $T_2$ is \dots and
$F:T_1\to T_2$ is conservative then $F^*:M(T_2)\to M(T_1)$ is \dots
.''



\section{Groups that are not CB}

\begin{defn} Let $P(\mathbb{N})$ be the permutation group of the
  natural numbers, equipped with the topology of pointwise
  convergence. (TO DO: explain the sense in which this topology on
  $P(\mathbb{N})$ is definable from the theory of infinite
  sets. Explain more generally the sense in which for a
  $\Sigma$-structure $M$, $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$ is naturally a topological
  group.) \end{defn}

\begin{fact} Let $G$ be a subgroup of $P(\mathbb{N})$. Then $G$ is the
  automorphism group of an $\aleph _0$-categorical theory iff $G$ is
  a closed subset of $P(\mathbb{N})$. \end{fact}

\begin{conj} There are closed subgroups $G$ and $H$ of
  $P(\mathbb{N})$ such that $G$ is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of
  $H$ and vice versa, but $G$ and $H$ are not
  isomorphic. \end{conj}

It is not difficult at all to find groups that violate the
Cantor-Bernstein condition --- but I do not immediately know if any of
these groups are of the form $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$ for an
$\aleph _0$-categorical structure $M$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The group $S_\infty$ of finite permutations of $\mathbb{N}$ and
  the alternating grooup $A_\infty$. See  \url{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1259081/if-there-are-injective-homomorphisms-between-two-groups-in-both-directions-are}
\item Infinite direct sums of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^i}$.
\item The free group on $2$ generators and the free group on $3$ generators.  
\end{enumerate}

\begin{prop}[\cite{ahlbrandt1986}] Two countable
  $\aleph _0$-categorical structures are bi-interpretable iff their
  automorphism groups are isomorphic as topological groups. \end{prop}

Conjecture: the previous result can be lifted to
$\aleph _0$-categorical theories (with countable signature). But we
need to be careful about terminology. First of all, Ahlbrandt and
Ziegler are working with a notion of ``interpretation'' between
structures of one language and structures of another language: given a
$\Sigma _1$-structure $\3M _1$ and a $\Sigma _2$-structure $\3M _2$,
and interpretation $f:\3M_1\to \3M_2$ consists of a surjection
$f:U\to M_2$ where $U$ is a definable subset of the domain of $\3M_1$
and $M_2$ is the domain of $\3M_2$, etc.

\begin{conj} An interpretation from $\3M_1$ to $\3M_2$ is a
  translation in our sense from $Th(\3M_1)$ to $Th(\3M_2)$. \end{conj}

The following proposition follows immediately from the fact that
$\aleph _0$-categorical theories are complete.

\begin{prop} If $T$ is $\aleph _0$-categorical with unique model
  $\3M$, then $T$ is logically equivalent to $Th(\3M )$. \end{prop}

This result would be interesting because it would show that the
structure of an $\aleph _0$-categorical theory is captured by its
countable model. i.e., there is no need to look at the models of
higher cardinality and the arrows between them.

\begin{prop}[\cite{evans1990}] There are closed subgroups $G$ and $H$
  of $P(\mathbb{N})$ that are isomorphic qua groups but not as
  topological groups. Hence, the corresponding structures are not
  bi-interpretable. \end{prop}

The former result is intriguing: there is a group isomorphism
$\varphi :G\xlongrightarrow{\sim} H$ that does not correspond to a
homotopy equivalence between the corresponding theories. In short: the
symmetries of the model are not enough to capture the structure of the
theories.

\section{$\aleph _0$-categorical theories}

For this discussion, we restrict to theories with countable
signatures. In this case, the downward L{\"o}wenheim-Skolem theorem
shows that an $\aleph _0$-categorical theory is complete.

Question: How can we characterize the syntactic categories of
$\aleph _0$-categorical theories? (Hint: Look at the Ryll-Nardzewski
theorem \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-categorical_theory}
and \citep[p 30]{cameron1990}. I suspect that the characterization
will have something to do with finiteness of subobject lattices.)

TO DO: Establish a correspondence between the $2$-category of
$\aleph _0$-categorical theories and some subcategory of the
$2$-category of topological groups. Note 1: every group is a category,
and group homomorphisms are functors.  Note 2: all translations
between such theories are conservative. It will be helpful to look at
pages 106--107 of \citep{cameron1990} where he describes conditions on
a topological group $G$ that ensure it corresponds to a categorical
theory.



\begin{defn} Given an $\aleph _0$-categorical theory $T$, let
  $\3G (T)$ be the topological group of automorphisms of its unique
  countable model. \end{defn}

\begin{conj} If $F:T_1\to T_2$ is a translation then
  $F^*|_{\3G (T_2)}$ is a continuous homomorphism from $\3G (T_2 )$ to
  $\3G (T_1)$. \end{conj}

\begin{conj} There is a 2-functor $\3G$ from the 2-category of
  topological groups to the 2-category of $\aleph _0$-categorical
  theories. (This is not stated correctly yet: we should not expect
  all topological groups to occur in the domain. It is only the
  ``nice'' topological groups, i.e.\ the automorphism groups of
  $\aleph _0$-categorical theories.) \end{conj}


\begin{conj} There is a 2-functor $\3F$ from the 2-category of
  $\aleph _0$-categorical theories and the 2-category of topological
  groups. \end{conj}
