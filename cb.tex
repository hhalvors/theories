\maketitle

The purpose of this note is to ask: under what conditions could a pair
of theories $(T_1,T_2)$ fail to have the Cantor-Bernstein or
co-Cantor-Bernstein property?

\begin{defn} We say that the pair $(T_1,T_2)$ has the Cantor-Bernstein
  property just in case: if $T_1$ and $T_2$ are mutually faithfully
  interpretable, then $T_1$ and $T_2$ are bi-interpretable. In other
  words: if $(T_1,T_2)$ does not have the Cantor-Bernstein property
  then (a) $T_1$ and $T_2$ are mutually faithfully interpretable, and
  (b) $T_1$ and $T_2$ are not bi-interpretable. \end{defn}

Here ``mutually faithfully interpretable'' means that there are
conservative (strong, equality preserving) translations $F:T_1\to T_2$
and $G:T_2\to T_1$.

\begin{defn} We say that the pair $(T_1,T_2)$ has the
  co-Cantor-Bernstein property just in case: if there are essentially
  surjective translations $F:T_1\to T_2$ and $G:T_2\to T_1$, then
  $T_1$ and $T_2$ are bi-interpretable. \end{defn}


\section{Examples of theory pairs that are not CB}


\begin{enumerate}
\item $T_1$ is the empty theory on a countably infinite propositional
  signature. $T_2$ is the ``fan theory'' with axioms $p_0\vdash p_i$,
  for $i\geq 0$. The fact that these theories are propositional does
  not (I think) indicate that they are pathological. However, these
  theories are incomplete and the second one is not finitely
  axiomatizable. In fact, the second theory is not equivalent to any
  finitely axiomatized theory.
\item The many examples of pairs of set theories described in \citep[p
  8]{hamkins}.
\item The pair of theories described in \citep{andreka}.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Results}

\begin{prop} If $T_1$ or $T_2$ is complete, then $(T_1,T_2)$ has the
  co-CB property. \end{prop}

\begin{proof} If $T_1$ is complete, then every translation
  $F:T_1\to T_2$ is conservative. So if $F:T_1\to T_2$ is eso, then
  $F$ is a strong equivalence, i.e.\ $T_1$ and $T_2$ are
  bi-interpretable. \end{proof}

Recall that $F:T_1\to T_2$ is conservative iff $F^*:M(T_2)\to M(T_1)$
is a full functor \citep{barrett2020}. Recall also that if $F$ is a
strong (equality-preserving) translation, then $F^*$ preserves
cardinality of models. In particular, if $T_1$ and $T_2$ are
$\aleph _0$-categorical theories, then a translation $F:T_1\to T_2$
induces a group homomorphism
$F^*:\mathrm{Aut}(M_2)\to \mathrm{Aut}(M_1)$, and $F$ is conservative
iff $F^*$ is surjective. (In fact, $\mathrm{Aut}(M_i)$ is naturally a
topological group, and I conjecture that $F^*$ is a continuous group
homomorphism.)

Recall that if $T$ has countable signature, and if $T$ is
$\aleph _0$-categorical, then $T$ is complete. The following result
would be interesting because an $\aleph _0$-categorical theory is
essentially characterized by a topological group, viz.\ the group of
automorphisms of its unique (up to isomorphism) countable model.


\begin{conj} There are $\aleph _0$-categorical theories $T_1$ and
  $T_2$ that do not have the CB property. \end{conj}

\begin{defn} Let $I$ be the set of axioms
  $\{ \exists _{>1},\exists _{>2},\dots \}$. We say that a theory $T$
  is essentially finitely axiomatizable just in case there is a finite
  set $E$ of axioms such that $Cn(T)=Cn(E\cup I)$. \end{defn}

\begin{conj} There are essentially finitely axiomatizable theories
  $T_1$ and $T_2$ that do not have the CB property. \end{conj}

\section{Groups that are not CB}

\begin{defn} Let $P(\mathbb{N})$ be the permutation group of the
  natural numbers, equipped with the topology of pointwise
  convergence. (TO DO: explain the sense in which this topology on
  $P(\mathbb{N})$ is definable from the theory of infinite
  sets. Explain more generally the sense in which for a
  $\Sigma$-structure $M$, $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$ is naturally a topological
  group.) \end{defn}

\begin{fact} Let $G$ be a subgroup of $P(\mathbb{N})$. Then $G$ is the
  automorphism group of an $\aleph _0$-categorical theory iff $G$ is
  a closed subset of $P(\mathbb{N})$. \end{fact}

\begin{conj} There are closed subgroups $G$ and $H$ of
  $P(\mathbb{N})$ such that $G$ is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of
  $H$ and vice versa, but $G$ and $H$ are not
  isomorphic. \end{conj}

It is not difficult at all to find groups that violate the
Cantor-Bernstein condition --- but I do not immediately know if any of
these groups are of the form $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$ for an
$\aleph _0$-categorical structure $M$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The group $S_\infty$ of finite permutations of $\mathbb{N}$ and
  the alternating grooup $A_\infty$. See \newline \url{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1259081/if-there-are-injective-homomorphisms-between-two-groups-in-both-directions-are}
\item Infinite direct sums of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^i}$.
\item The free group on $2$ generators and the free group on $3$ generators.  
\end{enumerate}

\begin{prop}[\cite{ahlbrandt1986}] Two countable
  $\aleph _0$-categorical structures are bi-interpretable iff their
  automorphism groups are isomorphic as topological groups. \end{prop}

I suspect that the previous result can be lifted to
$\aleph _0$-categorical theories (with countable signature). But we
need to be careful about terminology. First of all, Ahlbrandt and
Ziegler are working with a notion of ``interpretation'' between
structures of one language and structures of another language.
Basically, an interpretation $f:M_1\to M_2$ consists of a surjection
$f:U\to B$ where $U$ is a definable subset of the domain of $M_1$ and
$B$ is the domain of $M_2$, etc. (Is an interpretation from $M_1$ to
$M_2$ just a translation in our sense from $Th(M_1)$ to $Th(M_2)$?)

Second, note that Ahlbrandt and Ziegler's interpretations are more
like our weak translations than like our strong translations. 

\begin{prop}[\cite{evans1990}] There are closed subgroups $G$ and $H$
  of $P(\mathbb{N})$ that are isomorphic qua groups but not as
  topological groups. Hence, the corresponding structures are not
  bi-interpretable. \end{prop}
